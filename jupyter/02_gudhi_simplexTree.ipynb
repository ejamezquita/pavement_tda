    "TDA typically aims at extracting topological signatures from a point cloud in $\\mathbb R^d$ or in a general metric space. By studying the topology of the point clouds, we actually mean studying the topology of unions of balls centered at the point cloud (offsets). However, non-discrete sets such as offsets, and also continuous mathematical shapes like curves, surfaces and more generally manifolds, cannot easily be encoded as finite discrete structures. [Simplicial complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex) are therefore used in computational geometry to approximate such shapes.\n",

    "A simplicial complex is a set of [simplices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex). It can be seen as a higher dimensional generalization of a graph. It is a mathematical object that is both topological and combinatorial, which makes it particularly useful for TDA. Here is an exemple of simplicial complex:\n",
